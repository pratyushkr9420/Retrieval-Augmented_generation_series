The film begins with Bruce Wayne, a billionaire haunted by his parents' murder, leaving Gotham to seek purpose and redemption. After encountering Ducard, a mentor in the League of Shadows, Bruce undergoes intense training in martial arts, stealth, and fear. However, he ultimately rejects the League’s extremist philosophy of purging society through violence. Returning to Gotham, Bruce adopts the Batman persona, using his new skills and high-tech gadgets to fight crime from the shadows.\\nVillains: The main antagonist is Dr. Jonathan Crane, also known as Scarecrow, a corrupt psychiatrist who weaponizes a fear-inducing toxin. Through Crane, Batman encounters the League of Shadows again, with Ra’s al Ghul revealed as the true mastermind. Together, they plan to unleash Crane’s toxin on Gotham, driving its citizens to self-destruction.\",\n","  'Themes: Batman Begins dives deep into the themes of fear, justice, and identity. It explores how Bruce transforms his fear into a symbol that can instill fear in others, especially criminals. It also questions the nature of justice and the line between heroism and vigilantism.\\nSignificance: This film reinvents Batman as a grounded, psychologically complex character, moving away from earlier, more stylized depictions. The gritty realism, combined with moral complexity, sets a new tone for superhero movies, grounding them in social and psychological realities.',\n","  \"\\ufeffThe Dark Knight (2008)\\nPlot Overview: The stakes intensify in The Dark Knight, where Batman faces his most chaotic and cunning adversary, the Joker. As Gotham’s criminals begin to fear Batman, a new criminal mastermind, the Joker, emerges with a mission to unleash anarchy. His acts of terror force Batman, Gotham’s District Attorney Harvey Dent, and Police Commissioner Jim Gordon into a fragile alliance. The Joker systematically manipulates them, pushing each to the limits of their moral boundaries.\\nVillains: The Joker, played with unforgettable menace by Heath Ledger, embodies chaos and unpredictability. He orchestrates a series of horrific events that challenge Gotham’s heroes' morality, including Harvey Dent’s tragic fall from grace. Dent, transformed by tragedy into the vengeful Two-Face, becomes an unexpected villain, embodying the film's themes of duality and moral compromise.\",\n","  'Themes: The movie explores the thin line between order and chaos, justice and revenge, and how far individuals will go to achieve their ideals. Batman is forced to confront the limits of his code against killing, while the Joker represents the destructive power of moral nihilism. The film also deals with the corruptibility of humanity, showing how even the purest individuals can be pushed to the dark side.\\nSignificance: The Dark Knight is acclaimed for its dark, philosophical undertones and for Heath Ledger’s iconic portrayal of the Joker. Its critical and commercial success redefined the superhero genre, introducing a level of complexity, psychological depth, and realism rarely seen in comic-book adaptations.',\n","  '\\ufeffThe Dark Knight Rises (2012)\\nPlot Overview: In The Dark Knight Rises, an older, reclusive Bruce Wayne returns to the role of Batman after an eight-year absence. Bruce’s hiatus ends when a new threat, Bane, emerges with plans to destroy Gotham from within. Bane, a physically imposing terrorist leader, destabilizes Gotham by revealing its secrets and inciting rebellion. Batman’s return is complicated by personal struggles and physical limitations, which Bane exploits, bringing Bruce to his lowest point. In a final stand, Bruce must rally his strength and allies, including Selina Kyle (Catwoman), to save Gotham.',\n","  \"Villains: Bane, a brutal yet intelligent adversary, poses the greatest physical threat Batman has ever faced. He seeks to fulfill the legacy of Ra’s al Ghul and the League of Shadows by tearing Gotham apart from the inside. Talia al Ghul, Ra's daughter, is later revealed as an unexpected antagonist, adding depth and continuity to the trilogy's overarching narrative of justice and revenge.\\nThemes: This concluding film delves into themes of redemption, sacrifice, and resilience. Bruce confronts his own vulnerabilities, both physical and emotional, and must make peace with the idea of a life beyond Batman. The film also explores social themes, such as the power dynamics between the wealthy and the disenfranchised, highlighting the potential for upheaval within a city’s social structure.\",\n","  \"Significance: The Dark Knight Rises brings the trilogy to an emotionally and thematically satisfying conclusion. It emphasizes the need for a symbol that transcends a single individual and solidifies Batman as a legend, rather than just a man. The trilogy's end underscores the journey of a hero who has conquered his inner and outer demons, leaving a legacy of hope for Gotham.\"],\n"," 'uris': None,\n"," 'data': None,\n"," 'metadatas': [{'chunk_idx': 0, 'title': 'Batman Begins'},\n","  {'chunk_idx': 1, 'title': 'Batman Begins'},\n","  {'chunk_idx': 0, 'title': 'The Dark Knight'},\n","  {'chunk_idx': 1, 'title': 'The Dark Knight'},\n","  {'chunk_idx': 0, 'title': 'The Dark Knight Rises'},\n","  {'chunk_idx': 1, 'title': 'The Dark Knight Rises'},\n","  {'chunk_idx': 2, 'title': 'The Dark Knight Rises'}],\n"," 'included': [<IncludeEnum.embeddings: 'embeddings'>,\n","  <IncludeEnum.documents: 'documents'>,\n","  <IncludeEnum.metadatas: 'metadatas'>]}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":14}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def formatted_prompt(user_prompt,result_str):\n","  return f'''\n","  Instructions:\n","  You are supposed to answer question asked by the user stated under the user query section.\n","  Use the search results from a database provided under the search results section to answer the\n","  query of the user.
