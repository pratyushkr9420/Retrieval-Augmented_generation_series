# **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Lecture Series**

Welcome to the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Lecture Series**! This project contains a series of interactive lecture notebooks designed to teach students how to implement RAG, a powerful technique that combines large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge retrieval systems to generate more informed and relevant responses.

## **ðŸ“š Overview**

In this lecture series, you'll learn the fundamentals of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, how to integrate external knowledge sources into generative AI models, and how to build a functional RAG pipeline. Each lecture includes interactive code notebooks that allow you to experiment with the concepts learned.

### **Key Concepts Covered:**
- **Introduction to RAG**: Learn how RAG enhances generative models by leveraging external knowledge retrieval to create more contextually accurate and informative outputs.
- **Vector Databases & Embeddings**: Understand the importance of embeddings for storing and searching relevant knowledge in vector databases, enabling efficient information retrieval.
- **Building a RAG Pipeline**: Learn how to design a RAG system by connecting document retrieval with language model generation.
- **Optimizing RAG**: Techniques for fine-tuning the retrieval process and improving the relevance of generated content.
- **Real-World Applications**: Explore how RAG is used in applications like AI-powered chatbots, personal assistants, and knowledge management systems.

## **ðŸ›  Tech Stack**
This project uses the following tools and frameworks to help students understand and implement RAG:
- **Python**: For building the backend and implementing core logic
- **LangChain**: For connecting retrieval and generation components
- **ChromaDB**: Vector databases for efficient search and retrieval
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For hands-on, step-by-step coding exercises
